We are bombarded every year with devices with amazing specs: a flagship device with 4 GB RAM, an 8 GB device, or even one with 16 GB. On a desktop it really makes a difference. Is it the same on a smartphone? Even with 8GB of RAM, why does my app still crash when it runs out of memory?

While there are various attempts to make data pipelines more homogeneous and build your data needs around some ecosystems, the need to orchestrate your workflows is not going away - if anything, more and more of those pipelines depend on multiple tools in frameworks working together. And like an orchestra consisting of many instruments, they need to have an orchestrator - or a conductor for an orchestra - when playing together.\n \n Apache Airlfow is by far, the most popular workflow orchestrator in the world and its getting more and more relevant, especially that it becomes more than an orchestrator. Airflow 2 turned into modern Orchestration Platform. With Airflow 2.5 released just few days ago, cementing the ``Airflow being a Platform`` approach, you can do much more than **just** orchestration.\n \n This talk focuses on how you can leverage the new features of Airflow in fulfilling your Data Engineering needs.",
